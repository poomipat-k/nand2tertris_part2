# Nand2Tetris Part II – Software Construction Projects

This repository contains my solutions for Part II (Projects 7–12) of the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course) course, which focuses on building the software hierarchy of a computer system from the ground up.​

## 📚 Overview

In Part II of the Nand2Tetris course, the emphasis shifts from hardware to software. The projects involve constructing the virtual machine, developing a compiler for the Jack programming language, and building a basic operating system.​

The projects included are:

- Project 7: Virtual Machine I – Stack Arithmetic

- Project 8: Virtual Machine II – Program Control

- Project 9: High-Level Language – Jack

- Project 10: Compiler I – Syntax Analysis

- Project 11: Compiler II – Code Generation

- Project 12: Operating System

Each project builds upon the previous ones, culminating in a functioning software stack that operates on the Hack computer platform.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Go: Primary language for implementing the VM translator and compiler components.
- Hack's Assembly: Used in earlier stages for low-level programming on the Hack platform.
